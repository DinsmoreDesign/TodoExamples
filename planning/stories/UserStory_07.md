#### Story

As a user, I want to be able to delete all completed tasks, so I don't have to individually remove them and can focus on what's left to complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

* User is displayed an option to delete all "Done" tasks
* User no longer sees "Done" tasks in list after confirmation
* User is visually notified the delete operation is taking place
* Tasks are marked deleted in the database
